            <p>Author: <strong>WeKnow</strong></p>
            <p>Step outside your home and we guarantee you won’t be far from a tree; unless you live in the desert of course. From pine and oak, to willow and ash, we’re surrounded by a huge variety of different types of them.</p> 
            <p>And while they’re all pretty and wonderful to look at, their importance stems far beyond beauty. The value and purpose of trees is enormous; and their existence is vital for our survival. Below are just some of their benefits and what we’re doing to support the planting of trees.</p>
            
            <h4>The Environment</h4>
            <p>Trees help to combat climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide, removing and storing carbon while releasing oxygen back into the air. Each tree planted in your name offsets 0.3 tonnes of carbon - helping the planet for generations to come.</p>
            <p>They also reduce wind speeds and cool the air as they lose moisture and reflect heat upwards from their leaves. It’s estimated that trees can reduce the temperature in a city by up to 7°C.</p>
            <p>Other environmental benefits include the fact they help to prevent flooding and soil erosion by absorbing thousands of litres of stormwater.</p>
            
            <h4>Wildlife Restoring</h4>
            <p>Planting trees is also helping reverse the effects of deforestation for animals, wildlife and the planet. From birds and insects, to bats and squirrels, trees provide a canopy and a habitat for many species of wildlife. But they don’t just act as a home for wildlife; the fruits from trees provide food for them too.</p>

            <h4>Supporting Communities</h4>
            <p>Trees provide farmers and villagers with a skill and wage to feed and house their families, reducing extreme poverty.</p>
            <p>Trees can bring people together. They can act as a landmark within a neighbourhood and encourage pride amongst people within that community. </p>
            <p>Trees and woodland areas can be used to bring people together for educational purposes. They also allow for activities such as walking or birdwatching. In addition, they give children somewhere to play in and feel a sense of adventure.</p>

            <img src="assets/images/inner-blog.png" />

            <h4>Our Health</h4>
            <p>Trees help to improve air quality by intercepting and trapping dust and other pollutants from the air. The shade of trees also provides a useful barrier to harmful ultra-violet radiation from the sun.</p>
            <p>But it’s not just our physical health that benefits, our mental health does too. When surrounded by trees or taking part in nature-based activities, stress and depression levels can be significantly reduced.</p>

            <h4>The WeKnow Plant A Tree Scheme</h4>
            <p>In partnership with MoreTrees, WeKnow has a goal to plant 1 million trees, the equivalent of 300,000 tonnes of CO2. </p>
            <p>When you book on our website, you have the option to add a tree at the checkout, for just £1 you can plant a tree and offset 0.3 tonnes of CO2. For customers booking fully electric <a>Car Transfers</a> or <a>Hotel E-shuttles</a>, we will gift you a tree to say thank you! </p>
            <p>We also host a number of fundraising projects throughout the year to raise money towards planting trees, because we truly care about the environment and helping protect the future of our planet. </p>
            <p>View our virtual forest <a>here</a>.</p>
